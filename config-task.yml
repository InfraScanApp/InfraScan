# Task executable network: (Required | DEVELOPMENT, ARWEAVE, or IPFS) : IPFS is the default and common value
task_executable_network: 'IPFS'

# Task audit program: (Required) IPFS: Path to your executable | DEVELOPMENT: Leave it as 'main'
task_audit_program: 'dist/main.js'

# Round time: (Required) Duration of task, measured in slots (with each slot approximately equal to 408ms).
# 57 minutes = 3420 seconds ÷ 0.408s = 8382.353 slots
round_time: 8382.353

# Audit window: (Required) The audit window should be greater than 1/3 of the round time. Now set to 35% of round time.
# OPTIMIZED: Increased from 18 to 20 minutes for better global node support
audit_window: 2933.823      # ~20 minutes (8382.353 × 0.35) - More time for global nodes

# Submission window: (Required) The submission window should be greater than 1/3 of the round time. Now set to 50% of round time.
# OPTIMIZED: Increased from 20 to 28.9 minutes for better reliability
submission_window: 4191.176  # ~28.9 minutes (8382.353 × 0.5) - More time for network delays

# Minimum stake amount: (Required) The minimum amount of ISCAN that a user must stake in order to participate in the task.
minimum_stake_amount: 1

# Task Bounty Type: (Required | KOII or KPL) 
task_type: 'KPL'

# Token Mint Address: (ONLY task_type == KPL) Fire Token as an example here. 
token_type: "DSWQ7twRXgv6p3rbpECpXuPRKFR884zvDAebS8uNKG4z"

# Total bounty amount:  (Required) The total bounty amount that will be distributed to the task. (Not accepted in case of update task).
total_bounty_amount: 25920  # PRODUCTION: 30 days with 30 nodes (2,160 tokens/day × 12 days = 25,920)

# Bounty amount per round: (Required) Maximum distribution per round (safety limit only)
# Actual distribution is dynamic: 3 tokens × number of approved nodes
# This value prevents runaway costs if too many nodes join suddenly
bounty_amount_per_round: 90  # PRODUCTION: Safety limit for 30 nodes max (90 ÷ 3 = 30 nodes)

# Allowed failed distributions: (Required) Number of times re-submission is allowed for the distribution list in case of an audit, it is also the rounds of submission it will keep. 
allowed_failed_distributions: 3

# Space: (Required) Expected Task Data Size in MBs for the account size. 
# Minimum: 1 for production, 0.1 for testing; Calculation Details: https://www.koii.network/docs/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/create-task#space
