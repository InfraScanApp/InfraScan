# üì° InfraScan ‚Äî Mapping the Pulse of the KOII Network

Welcome to **InfraScan** ‚Äî a dynamic observer and silent guardian of the KOII nodeverse.

Each node that runs InfraScan becomes a vital signal in a decentralized mesh ‚Äî scanning, recording, evolving.

You're not just spinning up a node ‚Äî you're building the foundation for something far bigger. üß©

## üîç Why Run This Task?

- Help map the true shape and uptime of the KOII network
- Earn **$ISCAN** for staying online, responsive, and hardware-compliant
- Become part of an unfolding vision ‚Äî one update at a time

## üß† What's Under the Hood?

InfraScan collects and logs lightweight metadata from each participating node:

- Uptime patterns and availability windows
- CPU and RAM specs (non-invasive system profile)
- Disk type and available capacity
- Node responsiveness and health pings

This data is used to compute your **NodeScore** ‚Äî a trust and performance score unique to your machine.

The NodeScore will unlock future rewards and airdrops, as well as access to more advanced decentralized workloads in upcoming phases. üß¨

Hold **$ISCAN**, and you're more than a node runner.  
You're an infrastructure sentinel. üõ°Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Launch your KOII node
2. Add the InfraScan task
3. Stay online ‚Äî and let the data flow

## ü™ô Rewards & Incentives

- **3 tokens per round** for each successful node
- **1-hour rounds** with 24 rounds per day
- Future airdrops and exclusive features based on your **NodeScore**
- The more consistent and capable your node, the higher your rank

## üìÖ What's Coming Next?

InfraScan evolves in phases.

Each new release unlocks deeper insights, smarter scoring, and broader incentives.

We won't spoil what's coming, but here's a glimpse:

- **Phase II:** Advanced availability analysis and load profiles
- **Phase III:** Dynamic trust zones and reward scaling
- **Phase IV+:** üîíüëÄ (Encrypted... for now)
