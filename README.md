# 📡 InfraScan (BETA) — Mapping the Pulse of the KOII Network

Welcome to **InfraScan** — a dynamic observer and silent guardian of the KOii nodeverse.

Each node that runs InfraScan becomes a vital signal in a decentralized mesh — scanning, recording, evolving.

You're not just spinning up a node — you're building the foundation for something far bigger. 🧩

## ⚠️ BETA STATUS — Active Development Phase

🧪 **InfraScan is currently in BETA.**

This early release is live and scaled for over 1,000 nodes, but you may encounter bugs, inconsistent reward payouts, or intermittent round issues.

We're actively monitoring all activity and working with the KOII core team to improve stability and reward flow.

Thank you for participating in this critical testing phase. Your data, feedback, and uptime help us shape a stronger decentralized infrastructure layer for KOII.

Rewards are not guaranteed in every round during BETA — but your efforts now will help unlock a more stable and rewarding system, and may also qualify you for future airdrops and loyalty bonuses.

## 🔍 Why Run This Task?

- Help map the true shape and uptime of the KOII network
- Earn $ISCAN for staying online, responsive, and hardware-compliant
- Become part of an unfolding vision — one update at a time

## 🧠 What's Under the Hood?

InfraScan collects and logs lightweight metadata from each participating node:

- Uptime patterns and availability windows
- CPU and RAM specs (non-invasive system profile)
- Disk type and available capacity
- Node responsiveness and health pings

This data is used to compute your NodeScore — a trust and performance score unique to your machine.

The NodeScore will unlock future rewards and airdrops, as well as access to more advanced decentralized workloads in upcoming phases. 🧬

Hold $ISCAN, and you're more than a node runner.  
You're an infrastructure sentinel. 🛡️🖥️

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Launch your KOII node
2. Add the InfraScan task
3. Stay online — and let the data flow

## 🪙 Rewards & Incentives

- 3 tokens per round for each successful node
- 1-hour rounds with 24 rounds per day
- Scaled for 1000+ nodes with room to grow
- Future airdrops and exclusive features based on your NodeScore
- The more consistent and capable your node, the higher your rank

⚠️ **BETA Notice**: Some rounds may not distribute rewards as expected. This is part of the ongoing stabilization process and will improve with time.

## 📅 What's Coming Next?

InfraScan evolves in phases.

Each new release unlocks deeper insights, smarter scoring, and broader incentives.

We won't spoil what's coming, but here's a glimpse:

- Phase II: Advanced availability analysis and load profiles
- Phase III: Dynamic trust zones and reward scaling
- Phase IV+: 🔒👀 (Encrypted... for now)

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Warming Period: Rounds 1–3 have no rewards (prevents exploitation)
- Rewards Start: Round 4 and beyond receive full rewards
- Safety Limits: Maximum 4,000 tokens per round (hard limit)
- Fair Distribution: All approved nodes receive equal rewards
- **Only stake the task minimum. Any losses incurred are at the user's own risk**

⚠️ **Known Issue (BETA)**: Some nodes may experience skipped or duplicated rounds. This is actively being addressed.
